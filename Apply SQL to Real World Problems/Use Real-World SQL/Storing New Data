/*** Storing new data
You're planing to run a promotion on movies that won a best film academy award in the last 5 years. To do this you need to add a table in your database containing the movies which won an Oscar for best film.

The data you need for this exercise is provided in the table below:
***/
-- Create a new table called oscars
CREATE TABLE oscars (
    title VARCHAR,
    award VARCHAR
);

-- Insert the data into the oscars table
INSERT INTO oscars (title, award)
VALUES
('TRANSLATION SUMMER', 'Best Film'),
('DORADO NOTTING', 'Best Film'),
('MARS ROMAN', 'Best Film'),
('CUPBOARD SINNERS', 'Best Film'),
('LONELY ELEPHANT', 'Best Film');

-- Confirm the table was created and is populated
SELECT * 
FROM oscars;

/***
Using existing data
You are interested in identifying and storing information about films that are family-friendly.
To do this, you will create a new table family_films using the data from the film table.
This new table will contain a subset of films that have either the rating G or PG.
***/

-- Create a new table named family_films using this query
create table family_films as (
SELECT *
FROM film
WHERE rating IN ('G', 'PG'));
